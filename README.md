Movie Suggester Application
This is a standalone desktop application that helps you discover movies based on your preferred genre and language. It fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) and provides a user-friendly interface to browse suggestions.

No Python installation or command-line knowledge required to run this app!

Features
Movie Data Collection (Built-in): The application can download fresh movie data directly from TMDb. This process runs in the background to keep the app responsive.
Local Data Storage: Once collected, movie information (title, language, genres, popularity, etc.) is saved locally for quick access in future sessions.
Genre Filtering: Easily narrow down movie suggestions by selecting your favorite genres.
Language Filtering: Filter movies by their original or collected language.
Popularity-Based Suggestions: Get the top 20 most popular movies matching your selected criteria.
Intuitive Interface: A simple and clear graphical user interface for easy navigation.
How to Use
Download the Application:

Download the latest MovieSuggester.zip (or similar name) file for Windows.
Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your computer (e.g., C:\Apps\MovieSuggester).
Run the Application:

Navigate to the folder where you extracted the application files.
Double-click on movie_suggester_app.exe (or MovieSuggester.exe if renamed).
Initial Setup (First Run):

The first time you run the application, it will likely prompt you with a message that "No movie data found." This is normal!
Click the "Collect/Update Movie Data" button in the main window.
A confirmation dialog will appear. Click "Yes" to start the data download.
Please be patient! This process involves fetching a significant amount of data from the internet and can take several minutes depending on your internet speed and the data size.
The status bar at the bottom of the window will show progress updates (e.g., "Collecting for English (1/30)...").
The "Get Top 20 Movies" button will be disabled during data collection. It will automatically re-enable once the data is successfully downloaded and loaded.
Get Movie Suggestions:

Once data collection is complete and the app status shows "Data collection complete. App ready.", you can:
Select a Genre from the dropdown menu.
Select a Language from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Get Top 20 Movies" button.
The suggested movies will appear in the text area below.
Troubleshooting
"No movie data found" message: This is expected on the first run. Proceed with clicking "Collect/Update Movie Data."
Application is slow or unresponsive during data collection: This is normal, as a large amount of data is being downloaded. The application is designed to do this in the background, but heavy network activity can still make the UI feel less snappy.
"No titles found for the selected language and genre...": This means the currently downloaded data doesn't contain enough movies matching your specific combination.
Try selecting different genres or languages.
You can re-run "Collect/Update Movie Data" to attempt to get more comprehensive data.
Antivirus/Windows Defender Warning: Sometimes, executable files created by tools like PyInstaller can be flagged by antivirus software as "unknown" or "potentially unsafe" simply because they are not widely recognized. This is usually a false positive. If you trust the source (this repository), you can safely add an exception for the application in your antivirus software.
