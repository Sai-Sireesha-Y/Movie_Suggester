### 1. Download the Application

- Download the latest `MovieSuggester.zip` (or similarly named) from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sai-Sireesha-Y/Movie_Suggester/releases) section.
- Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\Apps\MovieSuggester`).

### 2. Run the Application

- Open the extracted folder.
- Double-click `movie_suggester_app.exe` (or `MovieSuggester.exe` if renamed).

### 3. Initial Setup (First Run)

- On first launch, a message like **"No movie data found."** will appearâ€”this is expected!
- Click the **"Collect/Update Movie Data"** button in the main window.
- Confirm the prompt to start downloading data from TMDb.
- Please be patient; data collection may take several minutes depending on your internet speed. You'll see progress updates in the status bar (e.g., `Collecting for English (1/30)...`).
- The **"Get Top 20 Movies"** button will be disabled during collection and re-enabled when data is ready.

### 4. Get Movie Suggestions

  - Select a **Genre**.
  - Select a **Language**.
  - Click **"Get Top 20 Movies"**.
- The recommended movies will appear below.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

- **"No movie data found" message:**  
  This is normal on your first run. Simply click **"Collect/Update Movie Data."**

- **App is slow or unresponsive while collecting data:**  
  Downloading and processing large movie datasets can take time. The application runs this in the background, but performance can vary based on your network and computer.

- **"No titles found for the selected language and genre..."**  
  There may not be enough movies matching your exact selection.  
  - Try different genres/languages.
  - Re-run **"Collect/Update Movie Data"** for a broader dataset.

- **Antivirus/Windows Defender Warnings:**  
  Executable files generated by tools like PyInstaller may sometimes be flagged as "unknown." This is a common false positive for new or unsigned executables.
